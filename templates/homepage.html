		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Q:</b> Why do you use the same logo as the CIA of America?</li>
	<p><b>A:</b> well, with our very limited budget from the government, we cannot hire a graphic designer. If you would like for that to change, please contact your local representative</p>
			<li><b>Q:</b> What kind of security does this site have?</li>
	<p><b>A:</b> Thanks for the totally inconspicuous question! :)</p>
	<p>We take security very seriously, which is why there is no way to log into regular accounts, making it impossible for bad actors to gain access. Plus, administrators are provided with a communicator which generates a 20-digit one-time password every five seconds, which much additionally be entered while logging in. This provides a layer of 2-factor authentication. My grandson is totally into computers, and he wasn't able to find any cracks in the system, so I feel confident that no secret documents, hidden plans, or inconspicuous pictures of honeycombs will be leaked from our databases</p>
